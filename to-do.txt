add the following:

- user (who is logged in)
- author (who created the note)
- Security Permission (depending on login, are you allowed to rwx the file)
- timestamps (created and modified, add all cases)
- backups (log for each backup)
- personal_notes (by author, a list that is timestamped)
- tags (by author)
- personal_notes (by user, anyone that has access to either see/read/edit for them to add - if permission is removed in the future, then their note becomes inaccessable)
- tags (by user)
